Hi. This is the personal website of Mario Fasold. My current position is CTO at [ecSeq Bioinformatics](https://www.ecseq.com/). 
Before switching to industry, I was a researcher at Leipzig University and its University Medical Center. 
I studied Bioinformatics and Mathematics, and received a PhD in Computer Science. 
Along the way I have founded a few ventures. You can find more information on the [About page](/about).
