Hi! This is the personal website of Mario Fasold. 
I currently serve as the CTO at [ecSeq Bioinformatics](https://www.ecseq.com/). 
Before transitioning to industry, I was a researcher at Leipzig University and its University Medical Center. 
My academic background includes studies in Bioinformatics and Mathematics, culminating in a PhD in Computer Science.
I've also had the privilege of founding several ventures along the way.
