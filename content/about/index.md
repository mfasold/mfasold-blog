I am interested in bioinformatics, software engineering management, genomics data science and entrepreneurship.

### üí° Research publications

My research focuses on the fields of computational biology and genomics.

- [Publications on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HbaZiXQAAAAJ)
- [Journal Publications on Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario-Fasold/research)

### üß¨ Scientific software and web services

I developed or participated in the development of several bioinformatics tools.

- [DARIO](http://dario.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/) - a web server for the analysis of short RNAs from high throughput sequencing data
- [AffyRNADegradation R Package](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AffyRNADegradation.html) - analyze and correct probe positional bias in microarray data due to RNA degradation
- [Larpack](https://web.archive.org/web/20161011085215/http://www.izbi.uni-leipzig.de/downloads_links/programs/hook.php) - Hook analysis of GeneChip microarrays
- [Github Page](https://github.com/mfasold) - Provding the source for these and other software

### :rocket: Entrepreneurship 
I co-founded the following startups.
