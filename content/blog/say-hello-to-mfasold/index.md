## Demo

- [hyas.netlify.app](https://hyas.netlify.app/)

## Why

Some website projects require a solid starting point. With a great developer experience and a sound user experience. Sometimes you just don't want to start from scratch. That's why I created Hyas üíö

## How

Making use of the power of Hugo. Following best practices for performance, SEO and security. Optimized for the Netlify platform. And always flexible, so you can easily make it your own.

## What

The Hyas goodness:

- Security aware
- Fast by default ‚ö°Ô∏è
- SEO-ready
- Development tools (linting, cleaning)
- Bootstrap framework ‚Äî v5.x
- Netlify-ready (functions, redirects, headers)

### And
